# DSA Projects

Welcome to the **DSA Projects** repository! ðŸŽ‰ This repository is dedicated to collecting algorithms, data structures, and various DSA projects implemented in different programming languages. Contributions are welcome, especially during **Hacktoberfest**!

## What is Hacktoberfest?
Hacktoberfest is a month-long celebration of open-source software held in October. If you'd like to contribute to this repository and make a meaningful impact, this is the perfect opportunity!

## How to Contribute
We welcome contributions from developers of all skill levels. Whether you're a beginner or an expert in Data Structures and Algorithms, feel free to contribute your solutions to common problems, or add new ones!

Hereâ€™s how you can get started:

1. **Fork** this repository.
2. **Clone** your fork to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/dsa-projects.git
3. **Create a new branch for your contribution:**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b my-new-feature
4. **Add your code to the appropriate folder or create a new one (e.g., Python, C++, Java, etc.).**
5. **Commit your changes with a meaningful commit message: (Example)**
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Added [Algorithm/DSA Project Name] in [Language]"
6 **Push your changes to your fork:**
   ```bash
   git push origin my-new-feature
   ```
7. **Create a pull request to merge your changes into the main repository.**
